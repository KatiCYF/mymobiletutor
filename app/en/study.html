										<p>Studying at any Finnish university is based on academic freedom. With freedom comes great responsibility on planning and making progress in your own studies. There is counselling available, but teachers do not automatically follow your progress. In case of any help, please reach out to various information sources, peers, tutors or university personnel.</p>
										<p>Faculties have different periods and systems in study-related practices and these can vary even between the departments. For this reason, it is wise to attend faculty information sessions, first lectures and be an active information seeker.</p>
										<p>More information can be found on the <a href="https://intranet.utu.fi/en/"><strong>intranet.utu.fi</strong></a> of the University of Turku. Below, you will find some common practicalities.</p>

Remember to bring an official ID with you! If you have a Finnish Identity Code and Finnish banking credentials, you can do the activation online.

										<p>Please become an active user of your utu-email from day one, as it is the main communication channel that will be used for all study-related issues! Teachers and other university members’ email addresses are usually of the form firstname.lastname@utu.fi.</p>

										<p>The recommended workload for one academic year is 60 ECTS. 1 ECTS = 27 hours of work (including lectures, seminars, reading, writing and independent work).

										<p>It is important to attend the first class of every course as all course-related information, instructions, schedules etc. are given at that time. You may also need to verify your attendance in the first meeting, especially in language courses.</p>
										<p>Classes follow the practice of an academic quarter. If the class is given at 12-14, it means 12:15-13:45. Exceptions can occur, but teachers will give you information about these.</p>

										<p>You have to bring your student card or an ID to the exam. Only pencil and other necessities for writing are allowed. The exam supervisor will give further instructions. Be on time and check if the exam will start at i.e. 14:00 or 14:15 (in exams, academic quarter does not always apply).</p>
										<p>Electronic exams are taken in an e-exam room using a computer. Many book exams and some lectures can be taken as an e-exam. You can take an e-exam also during the evenings and weekends if there are available computers. Exam rooms are located in Teutori, Agora, Publicum and Turku School of Economics. Exam rooms are locked and accessible only with an activated student card, printing tag or a key card that can be collected from the Student Centre Disco.</p>

										<p>The Student Union of the University of Turku <a href="https://www.tyy.fi/en"><strong>TYY</strong></a> is among the oldest student unions in Finland. Founded in 1922, TYY has been taking a stand for students for over 90 years. There is a student union (ylioppilaskunta) in each Finnish university.</p>
										<p>TYY is a public corporation completely independent of the University of Turku. The role of TYY is to represent its members, to advance the position of students in society and provide them with services ranging from consultations with lawyers to parties and sports opportunities.</p>
										<p>The membership of a student union is by law compulsory for all Finnish university students - and for those international students who are studying for a Finnish degree. It is possible for the exchange students to join a student union, too. Check out the instructions for joining <a href="https://www.tyy.fi/en/student-union"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
										<p>There are 144 sub-organizations (based on studying subjects, interests and hobbies) in the Student Union, so everyone should be able to find just the right one for themselves! Check the list of organizations <a href="https://www.tyy.fi/en/sub-organisations/list-sub-organisations"><strong>here</strong></a>. Events organized by TYY and different sub-organizations can be found from <a href="events.html">Events</a>.</p>
										<p>Representatives of TYY are there to help you, so just <a href="https://www.tyy.fi/en/contact-information"><strong>contact them</strong></a> or pay a visit. TYY <a href="https://www.tyy.fi/en/activities/tyy-wings/international-wing"><strong>International Wing</strong></a> is specialized in helping foreign students in their needs.</p>
