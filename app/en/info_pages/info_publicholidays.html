							<p>There are various public holidays in Finland, of which 10 church holidays and two other national holidays. Independence Day is celebrated on December 6th. In addition there are few festivities such as Shrovetide and Valentine’s Day, which are celebrated but are not public holidays.</p>
							<p>During public holidays, public offices (university as well!) and many private service providers are closed. Nowadays stores can decide their own opening hours, yet many of them are closed or have shorter opening hours during public holidays. Remember to check opening times and especially schedules for transportation.</p>
							<p>Nowadays more and more Finns celebrate also other festivities especially with their foreign friends. For example Chinese New Year, Eid al-Fitr, Halloween and Thanksgiving festivities can be found in Turku and in Finland, but they are not public holidays.</p>

											<p>Shrove Tuesday (Laskiainen) is not actually a public holiday, yet it is a festive time especially for university students and offers a nice chance to participate in student activities. The festivities take place in the middle of February (the exact date changes from year to year).</p>
											<p>The activities start in the morning and include some old and newly invented winter sports. The main event in Turku is the sledging competition on Vartiovuori, where hundreds of students gather to watch the student associations compete. Later on, the ’After Ski’ parties start and by the next morning, you have gathered some fun experiences that you will never forget!</p>

											<p>Easter week is often considered as the Holy Week for Christians and takes place in March or April depending on the year. Easter is usually celebrated in fairly calm manner with the family. The Easter holiday takes place from Good Friday (pitkäperjantai) until Easter Monday (toinen pääsiäispäivä).</p>
											<p>On Palm Sunday (Sunday before the actual Easter week), children go door-to-door dressed as witches. They give you a decorated branch of willow and you give them a chocolate egg in return. This is a typical Finnish tradition.</p>
											<p>Mämmi (Finnish Easter pudding) is a traditional Finnish Easter dish eaten together with cream and sugar. You should definitely try it despite of its peculiar looks. In addition to chocolate eggs, pasha is a must during the Easter time.</p>

											<p>Vappu is celebrated annually on April 30th to May 1st and it marks the end of winter. It is also celebrated as International Labour Day and is one of the biggest festivals of the year in Finland alongside Midsummer (juhannus) and Christmas.</p>
											<p>Vappu is the most important festival for university students and the aim is to have fun, be happy and have a great time with your friends! Some students start celebrating a week before, but the real action kicks off on 30 April afternoon with various concerts and other happenings all over the university campus and the city. At 17:30 it is time to move on to the Art Museum Hill where spring is welcomed with choir songs and champagne and the white student caps are put on. At 19:00 students gather down by the River Aura to crown the statue of Lilja with a student cap. After Lilja, the celebration of Vappu and the partying continues all around the city.</p>
											<p>The next morning families and group of friends head towards Vartiovuori in order to take part in the traditional 1st of May picnic.</p>
											<p>There are few specific Finnish things to try during Vappu. Try ‘sima’ (a traditional soft drink), and eat some ‘munkki’ (sugar-coated doughnut) and ‘tippaleipä’ (typical pastries for Vappu).</p>

											<p>The Midsummer (juhannus) is the period of time centered upon the summer solstice and the exact dates vary between June 19th and June 25th. It is celebrated for two days called Midsummer Eve (juhannusaatto) on Friday and Midsummer Day (juhannuspäivä) on Saturday.</p>
											<p>For many, the two days of Midsummer celebrations are the highlight of the year because the main features are usually plenty of food in the company of good friends, spending time somewhere in the countryside, the archipelago, or by a lake. The festivities usually continue well into the night as the sun barely sets on Midsummer Eve. North of the Arctic Circle, the sun does not set at all.</p>
											<p>A lot of Finnish-speaking people light bonfires, whereas Swedish-speaking Finns decorate a Midsummer pole, but both are at the centre for where dancing and singing take place.</p>

											<p>Christmas is a special time of the year for most of the Finns, both Christians and non-Christians. In addition to its main purpose as a Christian holiday, it is a time of the year to spend time and remember your loved ones, be generous and slow down from the hectic life. Christmas is traditionally celebrated with family and close friends at home.</p>
											<p>The whole December is often festive with Christmas parties at workplaces and with friends. In addition there are many concerts, markets and other nice events all over the city to attend to. Turku is actually considered as the <a href="https://www.turku.fi/en/christmas-city"><strong>Finland’s Christmas city</strong></a>. On December 24th at noon, <a href="https://www.turku.fi/en/christmas-city/declaration-christmas-peace"><strong>The Declaration of Christmas Peace</strong></a> takes place in Old Great Square, opposite to Turku Cathedral. Hundreds of people gather to listen to the declaration and it is generally considered the beginning of Christmas time.</p>
											<p>The public holidays takes place on December 24th to 26th. In Finland, Christmas Eve (jouluaatto) is the most important day when the Christmas dinner is served and presents are exchanged. If you have been nice, the Santa Claus (joulupukki) may visit you! Christmas Day (joulupäivä) takes place on December 25th and Boxing Day (tapaninpäivä) on December 26th.</p>
											<p>You should experience the traditional Finnish Christmas meal, which is often served in many restaurants already before Christmas. There are many specific dishes to taste such as ‘joulukinkku’ (Christmas ham), different casseroles made from root vegatables, ‘rosolli’ (salad with root vegetables) and wide selection of other salads, fish and meat.</p>
