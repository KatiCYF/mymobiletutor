							<h5 class="card-title  text-center">Social Habits</h5>
							<p>Describing social habits and giving advices on how to act in specific countries is always tricky, yet we try to describe the most common characteristics and habits you may encounter when living in Finland and communicating with Finns.</p>
								<p>Overall, Finns are said to be quiet and restrained people. It is true that many Finns do not express their emotions in public and they may find it weird when people are behaving otherwise (it’s a different story, when they’re drunk). It may take some time for a Finn to build a trust, yet Finns are considered to be very loyal, helpful and great friends.</p>
								<p>In ‘General’ we describe the wider features of the Finnish society and in ‘Working Culture’ and ‘Other Manners’ we give more practical advice. If you are interested to go further and to compare the cultural differences between countries, <a href="https://www.hofstede-insights.com/country-comparison/"><strong>Hofstede Insights</strong></a> offer a good tool to start with.</p>

										<p><strong>Flat</strong> hierarchy is one of the most descriptive elements of the Finnish society and equal rights in both public and private life are highly valued. It means, that superiors are not the only ones making decisions, rather people are expected to take responsibility of their own actions and independent attitude is valued. People seek consultancy and advice rather than orders and control.</p>
										<p><strong>Equal rights</strong> between genders are extremely important in the Finnish society. Today most women work outside their home and many women hold advanced positions in all the spheres of politics and working life. A lot to remain done, but compared to many other countries other equality issues are taken seriously as well. For example same sex couples can legally get married and adopt children and majority accept immigrants as a ordinary part of the Finnish society.</p>
										<p><strong>Individualism</strong> is also typical in the Finnish society and people value personal freedom and making their own decisions. In private life family is of course an important part of life, but close connections with all relatives and listening for example parents advice is not as common as in some societies. In studying and working life, evaluation, hiring, promotion etc. are based on performance and merit, even though you shouldn’t forget the importance of social networks in relation to many other aspects in life.</p>
										<p><strong>Quality of life</strong> is also highly valued; some people choose freetime, flexibility and meaningful work rather than higher salaries and positions. Showing one's (material) status is disliked and people prefer to use their money on well-being, cozy homes and several experiences.</p>
										<p><strong>Following the rules</strong> is one more important feature about the Finnish society! Most of them keep the society functional in efficient way. Anyhow, recently there have even been TV shows about unnecessary (and ridiculous) regulations. Despite of that, Finns follow the rules and dislike people bending them. And yes, majority of the Finns do not even cross the empty street when the red light is on.</p>
										<p><strong>Politics and especially religion</strong> is often considered an individual's private matter. Many Finns are quite secular even though majority belongs to a church. Do not be surprised if you cannot stir up a juicy debate about the most current political hot topics with your Finnish friends even though some may like it.</p>

											<p><strong>Flat hierarchy</strong> is very typical in Finnish schools and workplaces. Superiors are often accessible and easy to talk to. Superior role is to train, to advise and to make others to thrive rather than to micromanage and give orders. Nowadays teamwork is very typical and every group member is supposed to be active in decision making and taking responsibility.</p>
											<p><strong>Responsibility</strong> of your own studies and being a reliable team member is the key to being successful! You have to be an independent actor and active information seeker, as teachers and other superiors will not guide you to details. Of course, seeking help is allowed, but you should take responsibility of finding the information and considering options before approaching to others.</p>
											<p><strong>Direct and participative communication</strong> is typical and people expect to hear others’ opinions. It is crucial to share your ideas and participate in discussions; the superiors actually want to hear your ideas and constructive criticism! Relationships are often on first name basis, yet it is good to wait for elders or superiors approval.</p>
											<p><strong>Punctuality</strong> is a defining feature of the Finns both at work and in social life. Deadlines should be followed to the letter and not as a guideline. When you are off to meet somebody you might want to arrive five minutes early rather than five minutes late. It’s polite to let your contact know, if you will arrive late or if there is a delay in delivering tasks before deadline. Finns tend to link punctuality with reliability, and for that reason it’s advised to take it seriously.</p>
											<p><strong>Active Finnish silence</strong> describes the way most of the Finns participate in discussions; it is our way to listen, think and show respect when someone else is talking. Finns are willing to wait for their turn to talk, especially if the others are doing the same. This is especially noticeable, when Finns are participating important discussions and want to make a point, but it’s not very common when friends are joking with each other.</p>

											<p><strong>Greeting</strong> is often quite informal. When meeting a person for the first time, shake hands and say your name. It’s not common to introduce yourself with academic or other titles unless in an official and formal occasions. Friends often greet just by saying hello (moi, moikka, hei). Some people greet with a hug.</p>
											<p><strong>Names</strong> are quite simple in Finland and people introduce themselves by their first and last name or only with their first name. People usually ask each other to be at their first name basis and it is advised to follow this request. Married couples can adopt the surname of either spouse, keep their own surname or use double-barreled name.</p>
											<p><strong>Coffee culture</strong> is a defining feature of a Finnish lifestyle and Finns actually drink the most coffee in the world per capita. The most common question/sentence might be ‘mennään kahville’ (let’s have a coffee). Majority of Finns drink coffee in every form during the whole day.</p>
											<p><strong>Drinking alcohol</strong> is quite common in Finland. People usually drink on weekends, yet students tend to have drinks also during the week. The drinking habits vary by social group and also region. It is good to recognize that the blood-alcohol-ratio limit for operating vehicles in Finland is considerably low, penalties are severe and the police can test drivers at any time. Additionally, drug laws are very strict: use, possession or dealing of any drugs is prohibited.</p>
											<p><strong>Food</strong> in Finland is a mixture of European, Scandinavian and Russian influences. Traditional Finnish food is most commonly eaten on holidays, but there are still some dishes that are eaten throughout the year. Lunch is normally served from 11:00 to 14:00, and dinner around 17:00 to 19:00. Restaurants serve dinner usually until 22, the kitchen closes about half an hour before the official closing time. After that, you can still get food from any grill kiosque during late-night hours, which is a popular habit, especially weekends.</p>
											<p>Be sure to sample ‘everyday’ foods such as Finnish rye bread (ruisleipä), salmon soup (lohikeitto) and Karelian pie (karjalanpiirakka). Especially in Lapland many dishes consist of reindeer meat, and in Eastern Finland the traditional kalakukko (fish served inside a bread crust) is a specialty. Remember also to try out Finnish delicacies such as Fazerin sininen (the most popular chocolate), salmiakki, liquorice, blueberry pie and korvapuusti (cinnamon bun).

											<p><strong>Payments</strong> are mostly done by cards or online. Mobile payments are becoming more common and some service providers already accept them. Only some small market stalls may only take cash. Bills are always paid through online banks and many daily chores such as renting a washing machine in student village or charging your bus card is done online or with mobile phone.</p>
											<p><strong>Smoking</strong> is forbidden in all public buildings, even in bars and restaurants according to Finnish law. Nowadays, some block of flats has forbidden smoking also in the balconies. When visiting a Finnish home, smokers should always ask where it is allowed to smoke. University of Turku recently became a smoke-free campus and smoking is only allowed in <a href="https://www.utu.fi/en/university/smoke-free-campus"><strong>marked smoking areas</strong></a>. As a rule of thumb: if you find an ashtray, you are in a smoking area.</p>
											<p><strong>Queuing</strong> and waiting for your turn in any situation is an unwritten rule in Finland. It is about showing respect for those who came before you. Finns can be strict about this and you should never try to jump the queue. Queuing systems with numbered note-sized pieces of paper are quite common.</p>
											<p><strong>Tipping</strong> is not too common in Finland and service is included in restaurant bills. Tips are sometimes given in restaurants, if the food or service has been excellent, but it is not very common when e.g. buying a drink or paying your taxi driver. You will not be considered rude if you do not tip.</p>
											<p><strong>Visiting</strong> others is a nice way to get to know each other better, but it often takes some time for Finns before they invite a new friend to their home. This is especially typical for a bit older people. Remember to take off your shoes when entering someone’s home! Small gift of food, drinks or flowers is always a nice gesture.</p>

											<p>When living and studying in a new culture, the integration period can last for a while. You may feel homesickness, depression, difficulty to concentrate and irritability. It can also cause physical symptoms such as nausea, insomnia and loss of appetite.</p>
											<p>Realising that culture shock is a common thing and majority go through it on some level, it helps to recognize the symptoms and to cope with it. There are four identifiable stages of adaptation.</p>
											<p><strong>1. Euphoria</strong>: the new environment is exciting and you are enthusiastic and curious about everything. Your own home culture with its habits is still fresh and active in your mind.</p>
											<p><strong>2. Conflict</strong>: Feelings of isolation and loneliness are common as you become more aware of the cultural differences, and it may be frustrating. Comparing this new culture to your own is common, and many things seem to be much better at home. Familiar things, such as food from home and being with other people from your own country offer comfort.</p>
											<p><strong>3. Gradual Recovery</strong>: You accept the differences and similarities as you become more familiar with the new culture and new situations. You may feel relaxed and more confident in dealing with different aspects of the new culture.</p>
											<p><strong>4. Acceptance</strong>: As you become more involved in different social activities and get to know the people and the places around you, you will adapt to the new culture and create some sense of belonging. You may not even realise how well you have adjusted to the new culture until you return to your home country. Then you may experience a reverse culture shock.</p>
											<p>When you are experiencing culture shock, it is important that you deal with it in a constructive way. It is pertinent that you pursue a ”normal life”. Below are some ways to help coping with it.</p>
											<!-- Bulleted list starts here -->
